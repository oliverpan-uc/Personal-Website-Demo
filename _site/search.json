    "text": "Language in Earnings Reports and Stock Movement — Research Project, UCLA – Econ 188C\nInvestigated the relationship between CEO language in earnings call transcripts and short-term stock price movements using NLP techniques.\n\nCollected 56 earnings call transcripts from 7 companies over 2 years; filtered for CEO-prepared script only.\n\nApplied TF–IDF, chi-square keyness testing, and word embedding (GloVe) for feature extraction and classification.\n\nBuilt supervised classifiers using Random Forest and evaluated models using confusion matrices (TF–IDF model reached 63.64% accuracy).\n\nImplemented BERTopic for unsupervised topic clustering.\n\nFound that confident language correlated with stock price increases, while vague terms correlated with decreases.\n\nIdentified seasonal patterns: Q4 earnings calls (Jan–Feb) often followed by price increases; Q1 calls (April) by decreases.\n\nHere is my Project 2"
