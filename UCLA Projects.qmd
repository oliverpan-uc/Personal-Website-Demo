## **Predicting Sleep Duration From a Person’s Daily Information** — *Research for Introduction to Data Analysis and Regression*  

- Analyzed Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to assess how lifestyle variables affect sleep duration.  
- Explored relationships using linear regression, power transformations, and model diagnostics to improve predictive accuracy.  
- Built and refined multiple models (full, stepwise, and best subset) using transformed predictors to address non-linearity and heteroscedasticity.  
- Key findings: Higher sleep quality and physical activity are positively associated with sleep duration, while age and daily steps show negative associations.  
- Demonstrated expertise in model selection, residual analysis, and interpreting multivariable regression output.  
- Completed analysis using R.

## **Language in Earnings Reports and Stock Movement** — *Research Project, UCLA – Econ 188C*  

Investigated the relationship between CEO language in earnings call transcripts and short-term stock price movements using NLP techniques.

- Collected 56 earnings call transcripts from 7 companies over 2 years; filtered for CEO-prepared script only.  
- Applied TF–IDF, chi-square keyness testing, and word embedding (GloVe) for feature extraction and classification.  
- Built supervised classifiers using Random Forest and evaluated models using confusion matrices (TF–IDF model reached 63.64% accuracy).  
- Implemented BERTopic for unsupervised topic clustering.  
- Found that confident language correlated with stock price increases, while vague terms correlated with decreases.  
- Identified seasonal patterns: Q4 earnings calls (Jan–Feb) often followed by price increases; Q1 calls (April) by decreases.
